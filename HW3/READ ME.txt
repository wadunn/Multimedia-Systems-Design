Homework 3: DWT Compression

This program shows the steps in image compression and decompression. 
To run this program two parameters must be used:
First is the name of the image that is being compressed
Second is an integral number from 0 to 9 that defines the low pass level of the image compression being performed.  a value of -1 can also be used to show the progressive decoding of the image at each level. 

This program assumes the images are of the size 512x512.
Two rgb image files are provided in the repository for use

Example command to invoke:
java ImageDisplay stagforest_512_512.rgb -1
