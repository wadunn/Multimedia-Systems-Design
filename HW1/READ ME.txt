Homework 1: Quantization and Subsampling

The Java program, ImageDisplay, performs quantization and subsampling on an rgb type image.  To run the program you invoke the following command with the parameters listed below: 

First parameter is the name of the image rgb file.  This program assumes that the image is in an 8 bit per channel RGB format and of the size 1920wx1080h

The next three parameters are integers that control the subsampling of the Y U and V spaces. A value of 1 indicates no subsampling.  Values higher than 1 indicate subsampling in that color space.  We are subsampling only on the width of the images and not the height in this program.

The next two parameters are single precision floats which take positive values less than or equal to 1.0.  These control the scaled output image width and height respectively.  

Final parameter signals whether antialiasing is to occur.  0 indicates no antialiasing.

example input provided below. This will return an output image identical to the input image.  lake-forest_1920w_1080h.rgb is a provided example image file for running the program.   

java ImageDisplay lake-forest_1920w_1080h.rgb 1 1 1 1.0 1.0 0
